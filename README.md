# Moving a Python Virtual Environment to Another Computer (Linux)

This guide explains how to transfer a Python virtual environment from one Linux computer to another by recreating it properly.

## **Steps to Perform on the Original Computer**

### **Step 1: Install Virtualenv (if not already installed)**
Ensure that `virtualenv` is installed:

```sh
pip install virtualenv
```

### **Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment**
Navigate to your project directory and create a new virtual environment:

```sh
virtualenv venv
```

### **Step 3: Activate the Virtual Environment**
Before installing packages, activate the virtual environment:

```sh
source venv/bin/activate
```

### **Step 4: Install Required Packages**
Install your project's dependencies:

```sh
pip install <your-packages>
```

### **Step 5: Export Installed Packages**
Create a `requirements.txt` file that contains all installed Python packages:

```sh
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

### **Step 6: Transfer the `requirements.txt` File**
Move the `requirements.txt` file and any necessary project files to the new Linux computer using one of the following methods:
- **USB drive**
- **Email**
- **Cloud storage** (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.)
- **File transfer tools** (e.g., SCP, FTP)

## **Steps to Perform on the New Computer**

### **Step 1: Install Python and Virtualenv**
Ensure Python is installed by checking its version:

```sh
python3 --version
```

If `virtualenv` is not installed, install it:

```sh
pip install virtualenv
```

### **Step 2: Create a New Virtual Environment**
Navigate to your project directory and create a new virtual environment:

```sh
virtualenv venv
```

### **Step 3: Activate the New Virtual Environment**
Activate the new virtual environment before installing dependencies:

```sh
source venv/bin/activate
```

### **Step 4: Install Dependencies in the New Virtual Environment**
Use the `requirements.txt` file to install all dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **Step 5: Verify Everything Works**
After installation, check if the packages are installed correctly:

```sh
pip list
```

### **Step 6: Add .env file**
```
MYSQL_HOST=localhost
MYSQL_PORT=3306
MYSQL_USER=username
MYSQL_PASSWORD=password

POSTGRESQL_HOST=localhost
POSTGRESQL_PORT=5432
POSTGRESQL_USER=username
POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD=password
```

Run your script to confirm everything is set up properly:

```sh
python3 your_script.py
```

## **Summary**
By following these steps:
1. **On the original computer:** Create and activate a virtual environment, install packages, and export dependencies.
2. **Transfer** the `requirements.txt` file and project files to the new Linux computer.
3. **On the new computer:** Install Python and `virtualenv`, create a new virtual environment, activate it, and install dependencies.

This method ensures a smooth transfer of your virtual environment without copying system-specific paths.
